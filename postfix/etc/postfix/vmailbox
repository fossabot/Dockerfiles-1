# For your domain you should at least accept mails for this addresses
# and forward it to a valid user in your organization:
#abuse@domain.tld na
#postmaster@domain.tld na
#webmaster@domain.tld na
#hostmaster@domain.tld na

# Next you can specify individual users e.g. As with the users 
# above make sure that the destination host accepts mails for this
# users e.g. by creating the needed user accounts. For my Archiveopteryx
# server I've to create a account via "aox add user ..." command e.g.
#user.name@domain.tld na

# This is a "catch all" entry which accepts mails for basically
# everything. But I strongly discourage NOT to use it. E.g. if you
# accept all mails even for accounts that don't exist you'll make
# spammers very happy and may generate a lot of additional mail
# traffic for undelivered mail at least ;-)
