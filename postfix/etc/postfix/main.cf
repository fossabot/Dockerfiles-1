# The internet domain name of this mail system.

# $myhostname, is adequate for small sites. (default: $myhostname)

# the Kubernetes worker node the Postfix container runs on.

# The list of domains that are delivered via the $local_transport
# mail delivery transport. By default this is the Postfix local(8) delivery
# agent which looks up all recipients in /etc/passwd, /etc/aliases and
# /etc/mail/aliases.
# In this case it is sufficient to handle only local mails for domain
# "localhost" and "localhost.localdomain". That's mainly for locally
# generated (error) mails in the pod so that the mails can be forwarded
# elsewhere like a IMAP server. Most (virtual) mail domains/user are
# handled in the "$virtual_*" directives.

# The list of "trusted" remote SMTP clients that have more privileges
# than "strangers". In particular, "trusted" SMTP clients are allowed
# to relay mail through Postfix. See the smtpd_relay_restrictions
# parameter description in the postconf(5) manual. You can specify the
# list of "trusted" network addresses by hand or you can let Postfix
# do it for you (which is the default). See the description of the
# "mynetworks_style" parameter for more information.
# We basically allow "localhost (127.0.0.1)" relaying mails. I additionally
# allowed my VPN hosts which are part of my 10.3.0.0/24 network (that's
# basically the network that all Kubernetes nodes belong to).

# can be overruled with the transport(5) table.
# I use Archiveopteryx IMAP server. It listens on port 2026 (LMTP protocol) on one
# of my PeerVPN addresses. As Postfix pod runs as a DaemonSet it has access to the
# PeerVPN network and can connect to the LMTP port of Archiveopteryx to
# finally deliver the mail addressed to one of the user of the virtual domains.
# Replace www.xxx.yyy.zzz with the IP address of your LMTP server of course!
#virtual_transport = lmtp:inet:www.xxx.yyy.zzz:2026

# Virtual user map. The script "service/postfix/run" will create a map
# of the virual users you specified here. See file "etc/postfix/vmailbox" as
# an example and for more information. Basically you specify all users here
# for which you want to receive mails line by line.
