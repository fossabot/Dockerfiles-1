# Person who should get root's mail. Don't receive mail as root!
# Basically you should specify a mail address alias here that is
# covered in "$virtual_mailbox_domains" so that mails to this
# recipients get forwarded to the final mail destination
# (a LMTP server e.g.).
# Remember that the accounts specifed here are handled by the
# local delivery agent. "local" in this case means mails that
# were generated by some process in the Postfix pod and not mails
# you received from the "outside".
