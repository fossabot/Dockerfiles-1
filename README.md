# Dockerfiles

Here I am keeping the dockerfiles I create or use for my [projects](https://github.com/shaman007/home-k3s).

- PHP-FPM with everything the Wordpress and Nextcloud need. Non-minimal!
- Postfix container
- Dovecot
- Rspamd
- Rsyslog
- \*-cli images are used for backups
- Clamav
- Language tool that is not particulair useful, since it does not allow you to use Premium features
- VSFTPD: from https://github.com/fauria/docker-vsftpd.git, needed to be build for ARM support
